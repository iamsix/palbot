# palbot
A simple discord bot based on the latest [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

Documentation is terrible.
requirements.txt should be pretty good.
It's set up entirely as a docker container

trivia data comes from my fork of [j-archive jeopardy-parser](https://github.com/iamsix/jeopardy-parser) (modified to show the links for discord) forked from [the original](https://github.com/whymarrh/jeopardy-parser)

Currently uses config.py file to set the token and other bot info - I've provided a config.py.example file inside the config folder
